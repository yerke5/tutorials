    "# LESSON AGENDA\n",
    "# This tutorial is on implementing sorting algorithms in Python\n",
    "# We will cover 5 algorithms (sorted in ascending order of difficulty, except the last one):\n",
    "# 1. bubble sort\n",
    "# 2. insertion sort\n",
    "# 3. selection sort\n",
    "# 4. merge sort\n",
    "# 5. quick sort\n",
    "# (optional, subject to time availability) 6. counting sort\n",
    "\n",
    "# we will explain each algorithm verbally and provide pseudocode for #1, #4 and #5 (+ #6)\n",
    "# to help you get a firmer grasp of how simpler sorting algoritms work,\n",
    "# we will ask you to implement the first 3 algorithms on your own\n",
    "# for #1, you will have pseudocode to help you\n",
    "# for #2 and #3, you are highly encouraged to write them on your own\n",
    "# this way, you will understand how indices and array traversal works\n",
    "# please avoid consuting external resources for help \n",
    "# don't lie to yourself :)\n",
    "# ask the teacher for help if necessary\n",
    "# she will guide you to the right answer instead of revealing it right away\n",
    "\n",
    "# if you are interested in more advanced sorting algorithms, we can cover them in the next lessons\n",
    "# however, keep in mind that these algorithms depend on other data structures that you may not know\n",
    "# e.g. linked lists, heaps and binary trees\n",
    "# we will have to cover them first before we cover the algorithms\n",

    "# 1. BUBBLE SORT\n",
    "# this is by far the simplest sorting algorithm\n",
    "# however, just because it is simple does not mean that it is efficient\n",
    "# in fact, bubble sort is one of the slowest sorting algorithms out there\n",
    "# you will be asked to guess the complexity of bubble sort a little later\n",
    "# you can see how there is a tradeoff between simplicity of implementation and efficiency\n",
    "# the most efficient algorithms are usually the hardest to read, write and understand\n",
    "# but we have to start somewhere :)\n",

    "# VERBAL DESCRIPTION\n",
    "# start at the first array element and compare it with the second element\n",
    "# if the first element is larger than the second, swap them\n",
    "# next, go to the second element and compare it to the third\n",
    "# thus, you should compare every consecutive pair of elements and swap those that are out of order\n",
    "# continue traversing the modified array until no more swaps are made\n",
    "# if there are no swaps, it means that you did not find any pairs that were out of order, so you can stop sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "# PSEUDOCODE\n",
    "# your first task is to convert this pseudocode for bubble sort into actual code\n",
